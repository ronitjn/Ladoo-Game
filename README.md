## LADOO!
- A strategic betting card game for four players  

## Number of Players:  
- 4 players (2 teams of 2 players each).  

## Deck Used:  
- Only Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks, and 10s from a standard deck (20 cards in total).  

## Objective:  
- The team with the higher ladoo count at the end loses the game.  

## Game Setup:  
1. Shuffle the 20-card deck and deal 4 cards to each player.  
2. Players cannot show their cards except when required by the rules.  

## Betting Phase (Ladoo Bidding):  
1. Each player evaluates their 4 cards and decides whether to place a bid (take the risk).  
2. The maximum bid allowed is 10 ladoos.  
3. If a player decides to bid, they become the bidder, and their partner must reveal their 4 cards to everyone. The partner is then removed from the game for this round.  
4. The opponent team does not reveal their cards.  

## Gameplay:  
1. The bidder always plays the first card and chooses the suit.  
2. The opponent team must follow the same suit if possible.  
   - If they do not have the same suit, they can play any card (which will be treated as a garbage card).  
3. The highest-value card of the played suit wins the round.  
4. If the bidder wins the round, they continue playing the next card.  
5. If the opponent team wins even a single round, the game ends immediately, and the bidder loses.  
6. If the bidder wins all 4 rounds, they win the game.  

## Winning Conditions & Ladoo Settlement:  
- If the bidder wins all 4 rounds, their team’s ladoos are reduced by the bid amount, and any excess is transferred to the opponent team.  
  - Example: Team A has 4 ladoos and wins a 10-ladoo bid. Their ladoo count becomes 0, and the extra 6 ladoos are given to Team B.  

- If the opponent team wins even 1 round, the game ends immediately, and the bidder’s team gains twice the bid amount in ladoos.  
  - Example: Team A bids 10 ladoos but loses the first round. They now gain 20 ladoos instead.  

- Multiple games are played, circulating ladoos between teams.  

- At the end, the team with the higher ladoo count loses.  

## Strategy & Key Points:  
- The bidder controls which suit is played, making their choices crucial.  

- The bidder must carefully decide whether to risk bidding, as winning all rounds reduces debt, but losing even one ends the game instantly with a penalty.  

- The bidder’s partner revealing their hand helps opponents plan their moves strategically.  

- Bluffing, card counting, and predicting opponents’ hands are key to mastering LADOO!
